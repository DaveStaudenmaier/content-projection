# ng-content, ng-template, ngTemplateOutlet and ng-container

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.0.

This demo project uses a real-world use case to show you how to use `ng-content` to project HTML from a parent component's template to a child component's template.   It also shows you how you might use `ng-template`, `ngTemplateOutlet` and `ng-container`.

For an explanation, see my associated [blog]()

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests
